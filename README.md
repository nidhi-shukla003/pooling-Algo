# Graph Pooling Algorithm Implementation

This project demonstrates a graph pooling algorithm implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The notebook `graph_pool.ipynb` includes the implementation of graph downsampling, pooling, and related graph neural network operations for graph classification tasks.

---

## ✅ Features

- Implements graph downsampling & pooling layers.
- Uses PyTorch and NetworkX.
- Visualizes graph structures and pooling results.
- Easy to run in Google Colab.

---

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- NetworkX  
- Google Colab (recommended for easy execution)

---

## ⚡️ Usage

1. Open [graph_pool.ipynb](./graph_pool.ipynb) in Google Colab.
2. Upload required datasets (if any).
3. Run the notebook step by step:
    - Graph representation setup
    - Pooling layer implementation
    - Graph downsampling experiments
    - Visualization of results
